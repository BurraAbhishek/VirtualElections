        <div class="text-padded">
            <p1>Virtual Elections can be conducted officially by the Election Commission at times when an infectious
                disease spreads easily among the population, causing epidemics and pandemics. During public health
                crises like SARS, Ebola, COVID-19 etc. stay-at-home orders are implemented to protect the general
                public. This tool helps you to vote in the elections from the comforts of your home without having to
                take the risk of visiting the election booth, crowding and spreading any infectious disease.</p1>
        </div>
        <h2>Is this official?</h2>
        <div class="text-padded">
            <p1>Yes, you can use this tool to conduct elections. Any national-level, state-level or district-level
                elections are conducted by their respective Election Commissions. All other elections can be officially
                conducted by anyone.</p1>
        </div>
        <h2>What about the data which is sent?</h2>
        <div class="text-padded">
            <p1>Please contact the agency conducting the elections.</p1>
