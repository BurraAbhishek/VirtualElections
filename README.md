A free, adless and open-source voting platform to conduct elections remotely. 

This website is written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/). HTML is used for templating, [using CSS for styling](https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/VirtualElections/tree/main/src/css). JavaScript is used for client-side validations, [toggling between light and dark mode](https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/VirtualElections/blob/main/src/controllers/css.js) and [showing results](https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/VirtualElections/blob/main/src/vote_counting/results.php). An SQL database is used in this application. Connection to the database is handled using [PHP Data Objects](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php).
